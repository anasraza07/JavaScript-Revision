Scopes help us avoid naming conflicts 
Any varibale we create inside curly brackets will only exist inside the curly brackets
Strategy for Javascript:
1. Figure out what steps we need
2. Convert these steps into code
and this is called Algorithm
Falsy values:
false 0 '' Nan undefined null
except above list all are truthy values
Nan: when we do some invalid math
If the first value is falsy the guard operator will stop early and the result will be the first value, otherwise it wont stop early and give us a second value as a result
In default operator it will stop early when first value is truthy; it is to set the default value.
&& has a higher priority than || operator

07-Functions
a function lets us to reuse code and make our code easier to update
rules for function name: 
1. cant use special words ex. function
2. cant start with a number
3. cant use special characters except $ and _
best practice = use camelCase
Return statement: let us get a value out of a function
Parameter: put value into a function
